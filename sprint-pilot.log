Below are the suggested subtasks:\n\n### Frontend (FE) Subtasks\n\n1. **Design Form UI**\n   - Create a user interface for the form that includes fields for issue key, summary, and description.\n   - Ensure that the form is responsive and accessible.\n\n2. **Implement Frontend Validation Logic**\n   - **Issue Key Validation**\n     - Implement validation to check if the issue key is not empty and follows the required format (e.g., alphanumeric, specific length).\n   - **Summary Validation**\n     - Implement validation to ensure the summary is not empty and meets character limits (e.g., minimum and maximum length).\n   - **Description Validation**\n     - Implement validation to ensure the description is not empty and meets character limits.\n   - **Real-time Feedback**\n     - Provide immediate feedback for each field (e.g., error messages, success indicators) as the user types or interacts with the form.\n\n3. **Display Validation Messages**\n   - Create a mechanism to display validation messages clearly under each form field.\n   - Ensure that messages are user-friendly and guide the user on how to correct errors.\n\n4. **Form Submission Handling**\n   - Implement logic to prevent form submission if any validation fails.\n   - Ensure that valid data is sent to the backend API upon successful validation.\n\n5. **Unit Testing for Frontend Validation**\n   - Write unit tests to cover all validation scenarios for each form field.\n\n### Backend (BE) Subtasks\n\n1. **Define API Endpoint for Form Submission**\n   - Create or update the API endpoint that will handle form submissions.\n\n2. **Implement Backend Validation Logic**\n   - **Issue Key Validation**\n     - Validate that the issue key is not empty and conforms to the required format.\n   - **Summary Validation**\n     - Validate that the summary is not empty and meets character limits.\n   - **Description Validation**\n     - Validate that the description is not empty and meets character limits.\n   - **Data Integrity Checks**\n     - Implement checks to ensure that the data does not contain any malicious content (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).\n\n3. **Error Handling and Response**\n   - Implement error handling to return appropriate HTTP status codes and messages for validation failures.\n   - Ensure that the response format is consistent and provides clear feedback to the frontend.\n\n4. **Integration with Database**\n   - Ensure that the validated data is correctly processed and stored in the database.\n   - Implement any necessary database constraints to enforce data integrity.\n\n5. **Unit Testing for Backend Validation**\n   - Write unit tests to cover all validation scenarios for each form field.\n   - Ensure that tests cover both valid and invalid data submissions.\n\n### Additional Considerations\n\n- **Documentation**\n  - Update API documentation to reflect the new validation rules and expected request/response formats.\n  \n- **Cross-Functional Review**\n  - Schedule a review session with the frontend and backend teams to ensure alignment on validation rules and error handling.\n\nBy breaking down the story into these specific subtasks, we can ensure that both frontend and backend teams have a clear understanding of their responsibilities and can work in parallel to implement the required functionality effectively."},"estimation":{"storyPoints":8,"confidence":0.7,"notes":"Moderate complexity due to the need for both front-end and back-end validation.
